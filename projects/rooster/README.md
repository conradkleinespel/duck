# Rooster

Rooster is a simple password manager for geeks (it works in the terminal).

Rooster is made available free of charge. You can support its development through [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/conradkleinespel/) ðŸ’ª

## Features

Rooster has some unique goals:

- it is easy to maintain so that it **never becomes unmaintained**
- it **works completely offline** by saving your password in a single local file
- it stores **username/password combinations, nothing more, nothing less**
- it can **import/export** passwords from and to 1Password/JSON/CSV

Rooster protects your passwords with state-of-the-art cryptography algorithms:

- scrypt for key derivation (`n = 2^12, r = 8, p = 1` by default, customizable)
- aes-256-cbc for encryption
- hmac-sha512 for authentication

Supported operating systems include Linux, BSD and OSX. Windows is not supported at this time.

## Installation

To install Rooster, run the following commands as `root`.

On **Arch Linux**, install [Rooster from AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rooster).

On **Void Linux**, install [Rooster from XBPS](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/rooster/template).

On **Fedora**:

```shell
dnf update -y
dnf install -y curl gcc unzip pkgconfig libX11-devel libXmu-devel python3 openssl-devel libsodium-devel
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
source $HOME/.cargo/env
cargo install --all-features --root /usr rooster
```

On **CentOS**: instructions should be similar to Fedora, but it seems like `libsodium` is not available on CentOS and I
haven't been able to figure out how to install it. If you know, please let me know.

On **Debian**:

```shell
apt-get update -y
apt-get install -y curl gcc unzip pkg-config libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libx11-dev libxmu-dev python3 libssl-dev libsodium-dev xsel
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
source $HOME/.cargo/env
cargo install --all-features --root /usr rooster
```

On **Ubuntu 16.04/18.04**:

```shell
apt update -y
apt install -y curl unzip pkg-config libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libx11-dev libxmu-dev python3 libssl-dev libsodium-dev xsel
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
source $HOME/.cargo/env
cargo install --all-features --root /usr rooster
```

On **OSX**:

```shell
brew install curl libsodium openssl
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
cargo install --all-features --root /usr rooster
```

If you use **Wayland** instead of X11, install [wl-clipboard](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) and make sure you have the following
environment variable set: `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland`.

For other distributions, the various Docker files can help you find which dependencies you need.

Once you have installed Rooster (see instructions below), you can view documentation with:

```shell
rooster --help
```
