# Rooster

Rooster is a simple password manager. It helps you save username/password combinations 
through a friendly command-line interface. Rooster runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

Rooster is made available free of charge. You can support its development through [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/conradkleinespel/) ðŸ’ª

## Features

Rooster has the following goals:

- it is easy to maintain so that it **never becomes unmaintained**, it has existed since 2015;
- it **works completely offline** by saving your password in a single local file;
- it stores **username/password combinations, nothing more, nothing less**;
- it can **import/export** passwords from and to 1Password/JSON/CSV;
- it can run on a **wide range of operating systems**.

Rooster protects your passwords with state-of-the-art cryptography algorithms:

- scrypt for key derivation (`n = 2^12, r = 8, p = 1` by default, customizable)
- aes-256-cbc for encryption
- hmac-sha512 for authentication
